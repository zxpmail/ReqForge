# Changelog

All notable changes to Forge are documented here.

## [v1.8] - 2026-05-18
### Added
- Feedback auto-scoring: failures automatically infer Skill scores (Precision/Coverage/Efficiency/Satisfaction)
- Hard-trigger evolution: `check-evolution` hook injects `additionalContext`, forcing evolution-runner dispatch on session init
- Structured failure context: dev-builder passes `trigger_reason` + `current_skill` + `ai_action` + `failure_detail`
### Fixed
- Ratchet idling: feedback had records but no score data, preventing evolution proposals — now every failure produces scored data

## [v1.7] - 2026-05-18
### Changed
- CLAUDE.md trimmed from 309 lines to 59 lines — dispatch map only, details in core/docs/
- Detailed docs moved to core/docs/: file-structure.md, behavior-boundaries.md, memory-system.md, sub-agent-orchestration.md
### Added
- Feedback auto-trigger on failure (compile errors, review failures, verification failures)
- Anti-Rationalization Checklist with "skip feedback recording" positive/negative examples

## [v1.6] - 2026-05-18
### Fixed
- Product-Spec.md cross-platform claim corrected — both .sh and .bat hooks provided
- .gitignore now excludes .claude/worktrees/

- context-compaction hook entry in README hook table

### Added
